This is a little GTK-based metronome I wrote for [[http://kylatilley.com/blog/][Kyla]] to practice the
[[http://molt.ca/][Molt]] material.  It was created because the material contains a lot of
meter and tempo changes, which are hard to practice with a
conventional metronome.  So this one reads key, meter, and tempo
changes from a MIDI file.  Since we prepare all our scores with
[[http://lilypond.org/][Lilypond]], we have MIDI files that include all the requisite
information.

It needs ocaml, lablgtk, ocaml-bitstring, and a recent version of
ocaml-portaudio (one that uses portaudio v19) to build.

Despite the fact that it uses portaudio, I've only tested it with JACK
running.  There's something broken in portaudio's interaction with
JACK, so you might find that it won't obtain the correct ALSA device
if JACK isn't running.
